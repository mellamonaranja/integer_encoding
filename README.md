# Hard coding-Integer Encoding 

Integer coding encoding with same text but embodied different way.

This is the hard integer encoding steps.

1. Sentence tokenization
2. Using text_to_word_sequence from NLTK for lower case all the words
3. Using Regular Expression to take short word-the length is between 1 and 2-out
4. Sorting by frequencies using with lambda
5. Remove words with index greater than 5

# Using Keras coding-Integer Encoding 

This is integer encoding steps using with Keras.

1. Sentence tokenization
2. Remove words with index greater than 5
3. Count the frequencies of each words.
