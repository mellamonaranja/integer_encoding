# Hard coding-Integer Encoding 

Referred by https://wikidocs.net/31766

I just used same text but embodied different way.

And explain What is different my code from this book.

This is the Integer Encoding steps.

1. Sentence tokenization
2. Using text_to_word_sequence from NLTK for lower case all the words
3. Using Regular Expression to take short word-the length is between 1 and 2-out
4. Sorting by frequencies using with lambda
5. Remove words with index greater than 5
